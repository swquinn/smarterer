  ### Test to see if the guest environment is being created on a Windows-based
  ### machine. If it is, we expect Cygwin to be installed (for access to rsync)
  ### and that cygwin is on the Windows path, e.g.
  ###
  ### CYGWIN_HOME = c:/cygwin64
  ### PATH = %PATH%;%CYGWIN_HOME%/bin

  ### SHARED FOLDERS:

  ### Create shared folders for Vagrant to interact with; the primary
  ### development environment is rsync'd to the /vagrant folder, while
  ### the VirtualBox share is created in the /shared directory, e.g.
  ###
  ###   /vagrant -> rsynced folder
  ###   /shared  -> VirtualBox shared folder
  ###
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/shared"
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "rsync",
    rsync__args: ["--verbose", "--archive", "--delete", "-z"], #"--rsync-path='sudo rsync'"
    rsync__auto: true,
    rsync__exclude: [
      ".git",
      ".bower_components",
      "build",
      "doc",
      "node_modules",
    ]

  ### Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  ### using a specific IP.
  #config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "dhcp"
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.13.39"

  ### Host-to-Guest Port Forwarding
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 9090
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 443, host: 9443
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5000, host: 5000
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5432, host: 5432

  ### VirtualBox Provider Configuration
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    vb.gui = false
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "2"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4096"]
    #vb.customize ["setextradata", :id, "VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/vagrant", "1"]
  end

  ### Prepare and boot the box.
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "tools/vagrant/provision.sh"
  config.vm.provision :shell, run: "always", path: "tools/vagrant/boot.sh"
end
